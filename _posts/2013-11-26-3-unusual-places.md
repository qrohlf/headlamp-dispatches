The Northwest is full of incredible places, but some definitely get more glory and attention than others. Last summer, I headed out to go hike up Oneonta Gorge and was a little bit taken aback by how many other hikers were marching up the river and clambering over the log jams beside me. It was great to see more and more people getting outside and exploring, but I also found myself going through all my favorite lesser-known getaways in my head, thinking about those spots where you can feel like you're discovering something.

It's a little bit complicated to share places that are off the beaten track and recommend that people go there. Part of the draw of these secret spots is that they typically see few visitors - I've spent entire days on some of these trails without seeing another human being. Experiences like that can really reshape your perception of the outdoors, and so I write this in the hopes that others will be inspired to explore. Here are a few of the places in the northwest that are perfect to visit when you want to have an adventure that's off the beaten track.

#Siouxon Creek
The trails surrounding Siouxon Creek in Southern Washington will take you to some of the raddest waterfalls in the Northwest, and they're often completely deserted. There are plenty of options for day hikes, but if you have the time stay the night in one of the creekside campsites that are found on the upper portion of Siouxon Creek Trail #130. 

What sets this area apart is that it has waterfalls and scenery to rival popular Gorge destinations like Eagle Creek or Angels Rest, but the extra hour or so it takes to drive to Siouxon from Portland whittles to crowds down to where the area probably only sees one or two groups of adventures on any given weekend. If you can, go on a weekday and you'll be guaranteed to have the place to yourself.

The [USFS](http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/giffordpinchot/recarea/?recid=31636) and [Portland Hikers](http://www.portlandhikersfieldguide.org/wiki/Siouxon_Creek_Hike) have driving directions and trail information.

#The Benson Plateau
The Eagle Creek trail is one of the most scenic - and popular - trails in the Columbia River Gorge. However, few people know about the Benson-Eagle Cutoff, a barely-marked trail that branches off the Eagle Creek trail in between Wy'East and Blue Grouse Camp which climbs two thousand feet up onto the Benson Plateau. On a busy weekend, it's always satisfying to bump shoulders with tour groups, field trips, and dozens of other hikers for the first few miles of the Eagle Creek trail, then see the crowds disappear as soon as you start making your way up the Benson-Eagle Cutoff. 

The contrast in climate between the Eagle Creek corridor and the Benson Plateau is just as stark as the difference in popularity. Hiking up from 1600 to nearly 4000 feet, you'll see the moss and ferns give way to fields of thimbleberry, then beargrass. The spacing between the trees starts to thin out as you near the plateau, and you'll cross several thin and clear sub-alpine streams. 

My suggestion is to cross off whatever you have planned for next weekend, grab a map and a backpack, and head up the Benson-Eagle cutoff. Camp one at either Hunters Camp or Benson Camp (both are spacious campsites very close to water), then return via the Ruckel Creek trail. 

The Eagle Creek trailhead is located off of exit 41 of I-84. Green Trails #429 is the best map for this hike, as it includes the Benson-Eagle cutoff.

#Cape Disappointment Coastal Forest Trail
I have never once run into another group of people on this trail, and I've been hiking it with my family ever since I could walk. Even though it's a short hike, expect to see gigantic old-growth trees, wildlife, and ocean views. This is one of the few hikes that I enjoy just as much in the rain as in the sun - mist and raindrops just add to the experience. If you do this one, make sure to go all the way out to the rocky point at the tip of the loop - you'll be rewarded with tidepools, a great view of the ocean, and a nice spot to stop and have lunch. 

To get there, drive to Cape Disappointment State Park on the Long Beach Peninsula in Washington. The trailhead for the Coastal Forest Trail is
