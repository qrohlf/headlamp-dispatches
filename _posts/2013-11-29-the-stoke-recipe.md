You're stoked, but your buddy isn't. She/He seems to be under the impression that "I have work on Monday" is an acceptable reason to bail on what's sure to be an 18-hour climb of epic proportions. You know that they're flat out wrong. 

But what can you do? They clearly don't have [The Stoke](http://semi-rad.com/2012/09/do-you-have-the-stoke-2/).

Fortunately, I've perfected a simple 3-step method for forcing a buddy/significant other/complete stranger to develop a sense of Stoke:

#Step One: Photos
Find photos of the climb, trail, or destination that you want to visit. The more, the better. Then, email/text/bicycle courier the photos to them. This is most psychologically effective when they are at work, so make sure to send everything to their work address. Starting earlier is better when it comes to Step One, and make sure to continue to send photos until the day you leave for your adventure. Remember that telling you to stop is really their way of letting you know that it's working, but you'll need to send a few more before they're fully stoked.

#Step Two: Mind Games
Your next job is to convince them that they actually were planning on going on your trip, and just forgot. If you have access to their calendar, add your trip when they're not looking (in ink, of course). Whenever the trip is mentioned, act like they've already agreed to go. Call and ask them whether they were planning on bringing a stove or if you should bring yours. Basically, act exactly as if they had already agreed to go on the trip. Their confusion will help inhibit stoke-killing thoughts about deadlines and/or prior obligations. 

#Step Three: The Roxbury
If the first two steps don't up your buddy's stoke factor, it's time to bring out the big guns. You know that ending scene from *Night at the Roxbury* where Doug stands outside Steve's wedding with a boom box over his head, prompting Steve to realize everything he's going to be missing out on? Grab your skis, backpack, or climbing rack and head over to your friend's office, house, or tent. Your goal is to find a dramatic place to stand, hold the gear above your head, and emanate confidence. If you can get an accomplice to play Haddaway's "What is Love" while you do this, do it. Your friend will immediately realize what a mistake he's making by missing out on your rad trip, and repent.
