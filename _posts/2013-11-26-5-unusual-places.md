The Northwest is full of incredible places, but some definitely get more glory and attention than others. Last summer, I headed out to go hike up Oneonta Gorge and was a little bit taken aback by how many other hikers were marching up the river and clambering over the log jams beside me. It was great to see more and more people getting outside and exploring, but I also found myself going through all my favorite lesser-known getaways in my head, thinking about those spots where you can feel like you're discovering something.

It's a little bit complicated to share places that are off the beaten track and recommend that people go there. Part of the draw of these secret spots is that they typically see few visitors - I've spent entire days on some of these trails without seeing another human being. Experiences like that can really reshape your perception of the outdoors, and so I write this in the hopes that others will be inspired to explore. Here are a few of the places in the northwest that are perfect to visit when you want to have an adventure that's off the beaten track.

#Siouxon Creek
The trails surrounding Siouxon Creek in Southern Washington will take you to some of the raddest waterfalls in the Northwest, and they're often completely deserted. There are plenty of options for day hikes, but if you have the time stay the night in one of the creekside campsites that are found on the upper portion of Siouxon Creek Trail #130. 

What sets this area apart is that it has waterfalls and scenery to rival popular Gorge destinations like Eagle Creek or Angels Rest, but the extra hour or so it takes to drive to Siouxon from Portland whittles to crowds down to where the area probably only sees one or two groups of adventures on any given weekend. If you can, go on a weekday and you'll be guaranteed to have the place to yourself.
